As this is my digital writing portfolio, I thought it was important to include who I am. You can read all of my works and appreciate them, but I think in order to fully get a better grasp on anything I create, you must know who I am. Not only who I am, but more importantly (in this case), as a writer.

 I was born in Valencia, Venezuela. An outsider to the Americans. I came here when I was 6 years old, yet I still consider my time in Venezuela the most precious to me. I've struggled with my cultural identity ever since I got to college. Even though I moved to the United States at 6 years old, I moved to a place people call "mini Venezuela". In Miami lies a city called Doral, and it's my favorite place in the world. It's where I call home, after Venezuela, and there I found a haven where I never had to fully disconnect from Venezuela. Everyone there speaks Spanish and celebrates Venezuelan culture. Every single one of my best friends are Venezuelan. Yet, I come to Boston for college, and suddenly I'm the only Venezuelan I can find. It was difficult, and still is, but I decided to focus that struggle into what I came to Boston to do- learn.

It's safe to say, I'm a perfectionist. It's probably the most common character trait in an English major. When I do anything, I want it to be perfect, leading me to be obsessive and controlling. When I found my love for writing, I decided I needed to be amazing at it. I wanted to be an author and go into publishing, and only the best make it, right? So, I had to be the best that made it. I had a natural talent for it from the start. All my teachers growing up would praise me for my amazing writing. I always felt the best at what I did. Funny thing is, so did thousands of other people that would end up going to where I went to college, Northeastern. Getting here, I realized I was no longer the best. Instead, I was probably the one who had the most catching up to do.

It tore me apart at first. Val, who had come out of the womb perfect, (or at least she hoped), was no longer the best. She was nearly the worst. I hallowed in my pity for a while, but remembered that above a perfectionist, I'm stubborn. I don't give up easily. So, I put in the work. In my first semester, I watched as many of my friends let their grades slip, but I refused. I was going to take any criticism, cry about it for a little, and then apply it to my writing. Slowly, I got better. Nothing drastic, because that's not realistic, but there was also nothing drastically wrong with the way I wrote. It was the little things; the things I was too pride-filled to pay attention to in High School because I was already the best. I fixed those things, little by little, and felt myself get better.

During this process, I also felt myself let loose. I was no longer as perfectionist and insecure as I was when I first started my freshman year of college. Once my second semester hit, I applied these newfound mentality into my life. I was no longer an insecure writer who couldn't take criticism. I was no longer a perfect writer. But I was a confident one. I'm a writer who believes in each word I type or write. I believe I have talent. I believe I have a lot of writer potential to live up to. I also believe I'm still not the best at this. But I'm a writer who believes I'll get there. Step by step, mistake by mistake, I'll be better. I'll never be a perfect writer, and I don't want to be. That's not who I am as a writer. And I'm at peace with that.
