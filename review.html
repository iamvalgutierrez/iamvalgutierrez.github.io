You’ve recently completed the 5-page paper you’ve been working on for two weeks, and it’s due in 12 hours. You simply cannot take another look at it or your lunch might regurgitate. However, you must edit and polish it. If you, like me, have been in this situation you might, 1) need better time management skills, but most importantly 2) want someone to do it for you. Grammarly has advertised itself to be this AI spell and grammar check to help improve your writing. So, I put it to the test. 
</p>
<br>
   <p class= "indent">
First thing I noticed in the opening screen is that the “Sign Up” button says, “Get Grammarly, It’s Free”, which Grammarly tends to emphasize in their advertising. When you sign up, they make sure to ask you questions on what you’ll be using Grammarly for (i.e. if you’re a student, what type of student, what you’re studying, etc.). Eventually, after signing up, you get to the home page. On the margins, there’s a Menu Bar, with the options “My Grammarly”, “Trash”, “Account”, “Apps”, and “Premium”. Of course, no surprise there. There’s a premium option! So it’s not “free”. Certain aspects of it are free, but not all the tools they offer can be used for free. Immediately, I’m put off, but I decided to put my emotions to the side and begin to use their free tools. 
</p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">
I pressed the “New” button in the middle of the screen, and it took me to a new page with a blank screen and options on the right margin, that include, “Overall Score”, “Goals”, “All Suggestions”, “Correctness”, “Clarity”, “Engagement”, “Delivery”, “Get Expert Writing Help”, and “Plagiarism”. I uploaded one of my old essays for this review. After doing so, it gave me the option to pick my “goals” for “Audience”, “Formality”, “Domain” (premium option), and “Intent”. After picking my “goals”, red and blue lines underlined parts of my essay. The red stands for “correctness” and blue for “clarity”. The other two options offered, “engagement” and “delivery”, are premium options. On the margins, a thin bar is at the bottom of each of the 4 suggestions, which fills up with the assigned color depending on how many alerts you get. The fewer alerts you get, the better that area is, and the more it fills up. Once I understood how the alerts worked, I got to work. 
</p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">
For “correctness”, I noticed a lot of the alerts help with spelling and grammar. The advice Grammarly offers with the “correctness” tools could actually be very beneficial for writers and can teach them how to eliminate unnecessary terms. For example, I had a sentence in my essay that says, “but the maltreatment never stops there”. Grammarly underlines “the maltreatment” in red, suggesting I say “maltreatment” instead, which is a good pointer. The “the” in the sentence is unnecessary. Grammarly offered similar suggestions throughout my paper.  Other examples include the suggestion to get rid of unnecessary commas, spelling mistakes, and alerts when I used the wrong preposition and conjunction. Overall, I think this tool is a great way to proofread your essay for any grammatical errors. It caught a lot of simple mistakes that can be easy to glance over when you’re editing your own paper. 
</p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">
Next, I looked at the alerts for “clarity”. This tool, I found, wasn’t as helpful as the former tool. It tended to advise me when I was being redundant and unnecessarily wordy. However, I think it doesn’t do a great job of catching this. For example, in the essay, I wrote, “during this time period”. Grammarly alerted me that saying “time period” is redundant and I should use “period” or “time” instead. While this is somewhat true, it’s known that “time period” is a regular phrase many use to describe a period of time, so I felt like this suggestion didn’t add to my paper. The one suggestion I did find helpful was with catching unnecessary wordiness. For example, in my essay, I wrote: “put emphasis on”, and Grammarly suggested I used “emphasize” instead. Similar suggestions like this one were all over my page, which I found to be helpful. However, this tool wasn’t my favorite, but I have to give it its deserved props for its unnecessary wordiness suggestions. 
</p>

    <p class= "indent">
After using these two tools, my journey concluded with Grammarly, which is actually my biggest complaint. Grammarly is constantly offering its site to be useful for students and professors who need help with bettering their writing, for free. Recall the “sign up” button saying “Get Grammarly, It’s Free”, yet, the other two tools, which seem to be the ones that target the content of your writing, are only available for premium. The free tools can be helpful, I admit, but they really don’t add much to your writing. It’s a bit less wordy with fewer grammar mistakes, but then what? Grammarly offers much more than that, yet “correctness” and “clarity” are the only things you get for free. However, if you are interested in getting Premium, there are three payment options : $144/ per year, $60/ per every 3 months, and $30/per month. Grammarly advertises itself mostly to students, yet no college or high school student can realistically afford these prices which are ridiculously expensive for what the site is and who it advertises itself for (important: Grammarly doesn’t only advertise to students, but still). I’m sure the other tools offered are helpful, but I doubt it’s worth the prices. 
</p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">
I would only recommend Grammarly for help with grammar and wordiness. That is if you’re willing to pay ridiculous prices for two more tools and maybe a few more advantages. Furthermore, the way Grammarly is advertised as this free app is misleading considering more than half of the tools advertised aren’t free. Personally, I would only use Grammarly if I need to spell check my paper or watch for wordiness, but other than that it’s pretty useless, and they definitely do not follow through with what they advertise.
