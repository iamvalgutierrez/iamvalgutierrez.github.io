Now Sister Genevieve, I- I know why you brought me in here today. I’ve committed the most heinous of sins and you’re asking me to repent. No Sister Genevieve, say no more, I know! I know YOU know! You know about- (pause) about me and Big Al- I mean- Priest Alejandro. But, Sister, you must know why I did it! Sister Genevieve I’m sick of being a prude! I cannot go on living with the sahara desert in my pants! A woman has needs, needs that- as shameful as they are- I want to have met. That night, when I was helping Priest Alejandro dust his latest version of the bible, I began to have the devil’s thoughts in my brain! The electric sexual tension that was in the air was undeniable, and oh I know I shouldn’t have, but I did Sister Genevieve, I did! One thing led to another and (pause) we kissed! It was magical and I don’t care if the devil condones it! I don't care! I don’t even love God that much! I’m sick of this restriction, I am a sexual being! You really think the Virgin Mary was a Virgin! Bullshit! She lied once and now I have this chastity belt glued onto me. She wanted to be free with her sexual desires and so do I! So no! I don’t feel guilty Sister! I feel alive. And you know what? I’ll tell you one thing, I didn’t just kiss him, I was penetrated by him! God Sister, if you were there you would have folded too, I mean this man- he parted by legs like the red sea! He blessed me with his religious sword and I said the lord's name in vain that night. So I refuse to repent Sister because it felt good. (pause) Oh, you- you didn’t bring me in here because of that? You brought me in because you needed assistance with the kitchen. Oh, hm- well then. (pause) I’m banished aren’t I?
