I hate New York City. It’s insanely crowded, everyone there is rude or crazy, and it’s ugly. Yup, I said it. New York City isn’t the concrete beauty everyone makes it out to be. So when my best friends from home, Carla and Isabella, proposed we spend our spring break visiting our other friend Natalia in NYC, I protested. However, my best friends are persistent people, so I eventually caved. A few weeks later, I was on a flight to New York City for a 5-day trip.  
     </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">  
Before I left, one of my best friends from college, Alvaro, insisted on giving us a tour of the city as a New York native. He told me he was determined to change my perception of the city. 
     </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">   
Our “Alvaro day” started with a trip to the High Line. It was a charming park-like structure that offered beautiful views of the city as you walked around. The girls were having a blast with the views and they insisted on taking pictures of everything they saw. Although I definitely enjoyed the experience, my opinion hadn’t cracked. Yet. 
Next, we visited the largest Starbucks in New York. It was three stories tall and beautifully designed. The place offered a very aesthetic atmosphere where Isa, Nata, Carla, Alvaro, and I got to sit down and relax for a few minutes. 
       </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">
We then proceeded to visit Little Island. At first, I was confused as to what this place would look like, but once we got there I said, “Oh, it’s literally a little island.” The island is man made and borders the Hudson River. When we first entered the Island, there was a big park in the middle for children to play in. Naturally, Nata, Isa, and Carla immediately beelined towards the hoola hoops. Children. Alvaro and I laughed at their immaturity and went on to explore the island together. There’s many rocks and steps you climb to get to the top, but Alvaro took me through a specific route where I got to see the best view of the river and New Jersey. I was fascinated with the beauty of the cityscape and the water. Alvaro took one look at my amazed face and said, “See? You’re loving New York already.” I didn’t want to admit it yet (I’m stubborn, yes), so I shot back, “I’m amazed at New Jersey, not NYC.” 
     </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">  
Alvaro announced we were going on a bike ride. The terrified look on my face made Carla and Isa crack up in laughter. Natalia called Alvaro insane for even thinking we can bike ride in this city. He made sure to let us know that it’s super safe because we were going to go through a bike line that bordered the Hudson River, detached from the street. We caved, told him that if we died the blood would be on his hands, and mounted the city bikes. To my surprise, the scenery we encountered was incredible. Biking alongside the Hudson River to my right and stunning tall buildings to my left was an unforgettable experience. This wasn’t the New York City I was used to. The more I biked, the more my opinion of the city softened. And Alvaro was right, it was perfectly safe. Our bike ride lasted 30 minutes, and we stopped by the World Trade Center. 
    </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">    
“Alvaro, that bike ride was gorgeous!” Carla told Alvaro as soon as we arrived. I could tell she was specifically falling more and more in love with the city by the minute. The other girls agreed, saying they thought the experience was amazing. Alvaro seemed happy to satisfy their needs, and then looked at me with a hopeful expression. I told him, “You haven’t won me over yet, but yes, it was beautiful.” He gleamed at me and took us to the next part of our adventure. 
       </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">   
After the bike ride, we visited the 9/11 memorial and the World Trade Center. It was an emotional experience for all of us to see where the twin towers once lay and seeing all the names of the people who passed. 
      </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">   
Next, we boarded the ferry that would take us to Roosevelt Island. We were able to get incredible seats at the top of the ferry. As we sailed across the Hudson River, we saw the most breathtaking views of the sunset and the city’s skyline. It was then that I fell in love with New York City. The lights from the buildings contrasting with the dark orange sunset and the dark blue sky created a mesmerizing ambiance I’d never seen before. 
      </p>
<br>
    <p class= "indent">    
 When we finally got off, I was disappointed. It was nighttime and our day was nearing its end. As we were walking out of the ferry station, Alvaro caught up to me and asked, “So, how do you feel about NYC now?”. I smiled at him and shrugged, “It’s alright, I guess.” He rolled his eyes, laughing. He didn’t need me to say it, I had fallen in love with the city.
